general tomfoolery

In the good old days (of about 2 years ago) I vaguely remember being able to code, do OOP stuff, unit testing and all that jazz. Now I know literally nothing, except some stuff about sigma algebras. These are random collections of code I write for no explicit purposes other than to learn skills that people might actually pay me to do.

file1 - Simulates a bet scenario where person A charges person B some dollar amount per dice roll, and person B gets a dollar amount corresponding to the outcome of the dice roll. To make it a fair game, how much should person A charge? (Mostly working on getting comfortable with classes)
